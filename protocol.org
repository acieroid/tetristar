* Description of the field (FIELDSPEC)
The FIELDSPEC part of the FIELD command describe /changes/ to the
field. An example of a FIELD command might be:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
FIELD 0 0,0,1:1,0,1:2,0,1:1,1,1
#+END_SRC

That means that there are three cell that changed in the field of the
player 0, each change is separated by a colon. The first cell is
located at =(0, 0)= (top left corner) and is now of type =1=, the
second cell is at =(0, 1)= and is also of type 1, etc. This field
command in fact represent a =T= tetromino.
