Server:
  - Bonuses

Client 
  - SVG images: fix graphic glitch

Misc:
  - Write some documentation

BUGS:
  - Sometimes the connection is closed without any reason
  - Some problems with the signals in the client (with disconnect &
    quit)

Optional (simple):
  - Improve rotation (compare to other tetrises first)
    - Direction of rotation
    - Repeating layouts: S only have two rotations in tetris, but 4 in
      tetristar (two shifted by one case)
  - Remember nickname, server name in the client
  - Add error messages in the protocol
  - Verify lua input in both server and client
  - Move some lua code from the client and server to libtetris

Optional (harder):
  - Improve drawing performance: mainly, avoid creating a cairo
    context each time a drawing is made
  - Detect and reward T-spins
  - Find a cool way to reward combos
  - String formatting for tetris.server.send*
  - Teams
  - Spectators
  - Dynamically load plugin
  - Think about an "event" system for within the script, a-la
    Observable. For example, when a line is cleared, an event
    "line-cleared" is launched, and every function that subscribed to
    it is called. This will allow better extensibility
