The program 'client' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadRequest (invalid request code or no such operation)'.
  (Details: serial 409589 error_code 1 request_code 0 minor_code 0)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)

Random ideas:
  - Detect and reward T-spins
  - Find a cool way to reward combos (see how it's done in tetrisfriends)
  - Teams
  - Spectators
  - Dynamically load plugin
  - Think about an "event" system for within the script, a-la
    Observable. For example, when a line is cleared, an event
    "line-cleared" is launched, and every function that subscribed to
    it is called. This will allow better extensibility
