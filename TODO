Server:
  - See how some bonuses (blockquake, block bomb, random clear)
    behaves in tetrinet and implement them
  - Improve rotation (compare to other tetrises first)
    - Direction of rotation
    - Repeating layouts: S only have two rotations in tetris, but 4 in
      tetristar (two shifted by one case)

Client:
  - Remember nickname, server name in the client
  - Widget to connect as admin
  - Improve drawing performance:
    - Only draw what changed in the matrix
  - Factor the drawing area code

Libtetris:
  - Move some lua code from the client and server to libtetris

Doc:
  - Write some documentation

BUGS:
  - Auto scroll the chat to the bottom

Random ideas:
  - Detect and reward T-spins
  - Find a cool way to reward combos
  - Teams
  - Spectators
  - Dynamically load plugin
  - Think about an "event" system for within the script, a-la
    Observable. For example, when a line is cleared, an event
    "line-cleared" is launched, and every function that subscribed to
    it is called. This will allow better extensibility
