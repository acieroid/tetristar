Client

Misc:
  - Write some documentation

BUGS:
  - Sometimes the connection is closed without any reason
  - Some problems with the signals in the clients (with disconnect & quit)

Optional:
  - Detect and reward T-spins
  - Think about an "event" system for within the script, a-la Observable. For example, when a line is cleared, an event "line-cleared" is launched, and every function that subscribed to it is called. This will allow better extensibility

  - Find a cool way to reward combos
  - String formatting for tetris.server.send*
