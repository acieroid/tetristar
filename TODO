Server:
  - Bonuses
    - Add bonus "distribution" (eg. 5% nukes, 20% add, 20% clear, ...)
    - Implement all tetrinet's bonuses
  - Improve rotation (compare to other tetrises first)
    - Direction of rotation
    - Repeating layouts: S only have two rotations in tetris, but 4 in
      tetristar (two shifted by one case)
  - "Keep" a piece on the side (c in tetrisfriends)

Client:
  - Improve client layout
  - Remember nickname, server name in the client
  - Widget to connect as admin
  - Improve drawing performance:
    - Only draw what changed in the matrix
    - Draw the other part when necessary (GdkEventExpose.region)
  - Add colors to the chat (see http://www.bravegnu.org/gtktext/x113.html)

Libtetris:
  - Move some lua code from the client and server to libtetris

Doc:
  - Write some documentation

BUGS:
  - Sometimes the connection is closed without any reason
  - Some problems with the signals in the client (with disconnect &
    quit)

Random ideas:
  - Detect and reward T-spins
  - Find a cool way to reward combos
  - Teams
  - Spectators
  - Dynamically load plugin
  - Think about an "event" system for within the script, a-la
    Observable. For example, when a line is cleared, an event
    "line-cleared" is launched, and every function that subscribed to
    it is called. This will allow better extensibility
