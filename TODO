Server:
  - See how some bonuses (blockquake, block bomb, random clear)
    behaves in tetrinet and implement them

Client:
  - Remember nickname, server name in the client
  - Widget to connect as admin
  - Factor the drawing area code

Libtetris:
  - Move some lua code from the client and server to libtetris

Doc:
  - Write some documentation

BUGS:
  - Auto scroll the chat to the bottom
  - Sometimes when a piece is dropped it is not displayed

Random ideas:
  - Detect and reward T-spins
  - Find a cool way to reward combos
  - Teams
  - Spectators
  - Dynamically load plugin
  - Think about an "event" system for within the script, a-la
    Observable. For example, when a line is cleared, an event
    "line-cleared" is launched, and every function that subscribed to
    it is called. This will allow better extensibility
